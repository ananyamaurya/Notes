# Sets

SETS

* are collection of distinct objects and are initialized with curly brackets
* `e.g  s1 = { 1,2,3,4,9,4,5,5,6}`
* `>>> print(s1)`

{1,2,3,4,9,6}

* sets work similar to sets in discrete mathematics
* they have union, intersection and intersections similar to sets in discrete mathematics
* sets do not support slicing
