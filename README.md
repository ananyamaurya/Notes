# Data Types & Variables

Numeric Data Types

* Int
* Float
* Complex

&#x20;

String or Character / Sequences

* Lists
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Sets

&#x20;

Custom Data Types

* Classes

## Variable Initialization

a = 10                  { integer value }

b = 'anna'           { string value }

c = \[]                    { empty list }

&#x20;

a,b, \*c= 1,2,3,4,5,6   { a gets the value 1 , b gets 2 and the remaining are stored in c as list}

&#x20;

\|---------------statement-----------------|

&#x20; user\_age  =         30\*2/1

&#x20;                          \|--- expression---|

&#x20;

**Variable  Naming**

* lowercase\_lowercase
* Start with lowercase or underscore
* Can contain letters, numbers and underscores
* Can't be named after keywords
* Are case sensitive?
* Variable starting with  '\_' denoted private variables

&#x20;

CONSTANTS Naming

* Named in Capitals
* e.g  PI =3.14

&#x20;

\_\_DUNDER Variables

* Starts with double underscores '\_\_'
* '\_\_variablename' : variables can be named like this but it is not good practice
